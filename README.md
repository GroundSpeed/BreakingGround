BreakingGround
==============

This is the lab project and presentation used for the Breaking Ground with iOS Development class.

This is a beginners class to start developing iPhone or iPod applications using iOS.  Just bring your Mac laptop installed with El Capitain and Xcode 7.2 and you will create your first "Hello World!" application in the first hour of the day.

This course will give you the knowledge to start building iOS applications.  It will also give you the understanding of terminology to help follow along on other online training or presentations at the local CocoaHeads groups. Each topic includes some instruction time and some hands-on lab time. The material presented will also be available after the class has completed.

This introduction class was designed by Don Miller (GroundSpeedâ„¢) using his consulting experience and his teaching experience for the iOS development class at the University of Toledo.
